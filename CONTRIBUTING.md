##Ways to contribute to PeerLibrary

* contribute to the PeerLibrary source repository. For specific ideas:
    * check the [roadmap and milestones](https://github.com/peerlibrary/peerlibrary/issues/milestones) and related open issues. See especially the "for-new-contributors" label. If you would like to work on an issue, assign yourself to that issue.
    * check `TODO` comments in the code: there are quite a number of them which are of the "here is a dirty hack, do a real implementation" kind, which are a good way to start contributing. Some other TODOs will require waiting/coordination for other things to be done first
    * while reading the code if you do not understand anything, feel free to ask and then contribute a comment describing the code so that the next person will understand
    * changes made to the PeerLibrary source repository should include:
        1. The code implementation
        2. Tests run locally and on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) (not yet provided)
        3. Quality documentation
    * Note that you will need to sign our Contributor Agreement in order to submit contributions (not yet provided)

* read (and contribute to) our [wiki](https://github.com/peerlibrary/peerlibrary/wiki)
* contribute to the PeerLibrary source repository
* if you have your favorite open access journal or repository not yet integrated into PeerLibrary, add support for it; this goes especially for possible non-English open access journals or repositories we might not even know about; you can just [open an issue for it](https://github.com/peerlibrary/peerlibrary/issues/new) to let us know
* advocate at your local university to open its publications to be able to integrate into PeerLibrary
