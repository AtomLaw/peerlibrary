For ideas on what to contribute you can:

* check the [roadmap and milestones](https://github.com/peerlibrary/peerlibrary/issues/milestones)
  and related open issues
* check `TODO` comments in the code: there are quite some of them which are of "here is a
  dirty hack, do a real implementation" kind, those are a good start to contribute;
  while some other have to wait for other things to be done first
* while reading the code if you do not understand anything, feel free to ask and then
  contribute a comment describing the code so that the next person will understand
* read (and contribute to) our [wiki](https://github.com/peerlibrary/peerlibrary/wiki)
* if you have your favorite open access journal or repository not yet integrated into
  PeerLibrary, add support for it; this goes especially for possible non-English open
  access journals or repositories we might not even know about; you can just
  [open an issue for it](https://github.com/peerlibrary/peerlibrary/issues/new) to let
  us know
* advocate at your local university to open its publications to be able to integrate
  into PeerLibrary
